Hello!

Getting this weird error in diffusionMaps:
Error in .Call("R_igraph_arpack", func, extra, options, env, sym, PACKAGE = "igraph") : 
  At arpack.c:944 : ARPACK error, Maximum number of iterations reached
In addition: Warning message:
In .Call("R_igraph_arpack", func, extra, options, env, sym, PACKAGE = "igraph") :
  At arpack.c:776 :ARPACK solver failed to converge (1001 iterations, 0/51 eigenvectors converged)
