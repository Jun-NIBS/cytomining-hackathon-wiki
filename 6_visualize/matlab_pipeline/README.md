#Input files:
DMSO-normalized variance-feature-extracted single-cell data for 103 samples. Data for each sample is stored in tab-delimit txt format. The first row is the names of 29 selected features. Starting from the second row, every row is the data for one individual cell. In this example dataset, file names contains sample information: the mechanism of action (MOA) and compound/concentration for each sample.
